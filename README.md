## Features 
- Adds a üìù button. Solve a question and press it to mark the question as solved.
- Track the number of questions you solved today by a sticker at the top right. Click the sticker to reset the counter.
- A small cute face that changes as you solve more questions to help motivate you.
- Randomly gives motivational messages as you solve questions.
- See your stats on specific topics by looking just under the question panel. Refresh the page to update it.
- Receive a star in the stats for every 10 questions you solve from a specific topic
- A money system that can be customized in code. The app does not give you money, it merely securely determines the amount you should give yourself after solving a specific number of questions. The system is in early development and isn't customizable as of yet because I intended this application for my sisters; however, once more people start using it, I'll certainly make this system more customizable and write a guide on customization.
