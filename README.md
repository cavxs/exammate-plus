## Project
Get ready to have some fun and improve your problem-solving skills with this amazing script! The main idea is to help you track how many questions you've solved on the website. Every question comes with a cool button that, when clicked, marks the question as solved and increases the counter on the top left.
  
Check out the transformation!

And the best part? The counter refreshes every day! But wait, there's more. The face on the left side of the screen is like a cheerleader for your progress. It starts sad and gets more amazed as you solve more questions.

And what's better than a happy face? A happy face and money! Every time you solve a question, you'll earn some virtual cash that you can reward yourself with after a study session. 
  
To keep you motivated, the script will randomly jump scare you with motivational messages like this one:

And to help you focus, the script also shows your stats in the current subject just under the question display:

This includes the number of questions you've solved in each topic, so you know where to focus more. Keep in mind that some questions span over multiple topics and will count as +1 for each topic but only +1 for the total.  
  
Achieve more and earn stars! Every time you solve 10 questions in a specific topic, you'll get a shining ‚≠ê. And for a special treat, some questions will give you double the money! They have a special emoji next to them, so keep an eye out!
